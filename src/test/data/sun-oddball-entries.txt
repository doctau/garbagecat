1) This appears to be 2 scrambled log lines:

4952.007: [GC 4952.007: [ParNew4952.046: [CMS-concurrent-abortable-preclean: 0.082/0.190 secs] [Times: user=0.56 sys=0.01, real=0.19 secs]

4952.046: [CMS-concurrent-abortable-preclean: 0.082/0.190 secs] [Times: user=0.56 sys=0.01, real=0.19 secs]

This looks like some kind of concurrency bug. I think the only thing that can be done is manually datafix the log entries.
